st.markdown('The goal of this analysis is to examine the interplay between **urban development** dynamics, proximity to **public transportation** and **income**.')
st.markdown('Analysis will try to find answers to questions like:\n- Are there any observable trends in hosuing development relative to different distances from public transportation?\n- Are certain municipalities better connected to public transportation?\n- How does the accessibility of residential areas to communication vary across different income brackets?\n- Is newly build hosuing better connected to public transportation or not? What is the trend?')

"\n- 1000m"
"\n- 2000m")

To obtain common score for each municipality, the Conectivity Score was calucated giving higher weight to houses that are closer to public transportation"
